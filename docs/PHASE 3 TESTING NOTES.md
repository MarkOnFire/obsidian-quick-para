- I do think a button for cancelling all open tasks in a note and moving it to the archive would be useful. 





Addressed
- I'm not finding all the ribbon buttons all that useful. Can we remove those and just have all those functions for re-tagging things live in the config page for Quick PARA? 
- I think I would like all open tasks in an archived note to be automatically cancelled, but not all users would like that. Can we make that a toggle in that section of the config screen?
