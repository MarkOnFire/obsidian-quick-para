- Produced thumbnails (new task for Digital?)

#### Blocked/feedback needed

- Archival content wrap-up
- Which of these should we break out into a new show bucket?
- Polka!
- Bottoms Up
- Nancy Zieman: Extraordinary Grace
- Vel Phillips
- Just flagging an ancient to-do item — should we be on the look out for any extra/bonus content for any of these?
- There are still a lot of [PBS Wisconsin Documentaries](https://pbswisconsin.org/watch/pbs-wisconsin-documentaries/) that aren't on YouTube. Do we want to start slotting those in to be posted there, either on our timeline or to align with when they re-air on broadcast?
- Looking ahead on YouTube Collaborations with main YouTube channel
- Currently in use for PBS Wisconsin Education series that cross over with GA, as well as most of their Shorts content.
- Also exploring partnership with PBS LearningMedia on two TLB episodes they co-sponsored.
- Do we want to develop more robust guidelines for this? Some edge cases that have come up that we should talk through:
- Asking Molly (the host of 'Polka') to accept a collaboration on the doc.
- Mile of Music —  inviting the festival for the main doc, as well as artists on their specific performer videos (idea from promotions)
- Wisconsin Foodie and Main Streets
- Questions to answer:
- When do we simply tag someone, versus adding them as a collaborator?
- Who makes the ask?
- Check in with Becky about how we're exporting this data?
- Check in on [Content Calendar](https://airtable.com/appZ2HGwhiifQToB6/pagyYMPikswWlFv4Q) workflow — is it getting too unwieldy? Or if we populate this ahead enough is it becoming a better collaboration/task management tool?
- Appears to be filtered out of general task queue now.
- Edge cases I haven't considered? (see The Ways "web development")

#### Feedback/updates/notes from Tim

- Title card use as thumbnail on YouTube?
- Who is uploading YouTube Shorts for news?

- PBS Wisconsin connects with communities across the state, sparking dialogue, encouraging lifelong learning, and fostering a sense of belonging. With free screenings, localized community celebrations that connect our programming to your neighborhood, and large-scale gatherings like the annual Great Wisconsin Quilt Show -- we hope to create meaningful opportunities for people across the state to connect, engage, celebrate, and learn together. Find PBS Wisconsin events here.
- Bucky!
- pbswisconsin.org/bucky to be ready and pointing to the trailer by September 22.
-  Fill out the [Wikipedia sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uUt8aeb3NO-WcGuqIubMrWCGKnQGCtv1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109366154158482165495&rtpof=true&sd=true) for Bucky!  Start on page 11.

- Whoopensocker
- Just received revisions for SSoT copy, will work on finalizing/YouTube in the next day or so.
- In Focus
- Apparently it's coming back! I have my backup tasks on the backburner but I will get them done next week once the Education slate is somewhat clear.
- WI Life
- Fill out the [Wikipedia sheet for WI Life](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1416WbTC4XnnYNH2OMQG-nt0TTqdYurgP/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109366154158482165495&rtpof=true&sd=true). We need to talk about a reasonable approach to seasons and episodes to represent.
- We'll be looking at 1-2 new segments a week plus the broadcast episodes during the main season, with 2-4 digital shorts posted throughout the week of each broadcast. We should look at the data but I think posted 2x a week might be a bit much in the lead up to a new season — we should try to smooth it out so we have new WI Life year round, and maybe 2x as much throughout the broadcast season.
- Need to set up a scheduling meeting with Mike and Sigrid (Welcome Poets)
- Set a date to look at the past year of engagement and determine if any changes to distribution are needed.
