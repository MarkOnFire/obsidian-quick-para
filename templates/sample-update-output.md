## 📝 Template Design Notes

**Key Improvements in This Template:**

1. **Activity-Based Project Sorting** - Top 10 most active projects (by completed tasks) shown with full details, remaining projects in concise one-line format
2. **Smart Task Queries** - Dynamic Tasks plugin queries filter to:
   - Recently completed (last 7 days)
   - High priority or due soon (next 7 days)
   - Daily duties coming up
   - Inactive projects for review
3. **Universal Approach** - No assumptions about naming conventions or prefixes, works for any project structure
4. **Inactive Project Digest** - Auto-identifies projects untouched for 30+ days
5. **Preserved Manual Sections** - Feedback, action items, and notes remain user-editable

**Query Customization:**

Adjust date ranges in Tasks queries:
- `done after 2025-11-10` → Change to `done after {{last-week-date}}`
- `due before 2025-11-24` → Change to `due before in 7 days`
- `done before 2025-10-17` → Calculate 30 days ago dynamically

**Priority Indicators:**
- ⏫ = Highest priority
- 🔼 = High priority
- Use in queries: `priority is above medium`

**Folder Filters:**
- `path includes 1 - Projects/PBSWI` → Adjust to your project folder
- `path includes ARCHIVE` → Exclude archived items
- `path includes Daily Duties` → Target recurring tasks
